Please, complete and correct this specification.

I want a website developed with python, flask, sqlalchemy, and tailwind css.
The purpose of the website is to configure some tasks and display the reports of the tasks.
The website has a tree of pages:
The first level page has links to the second level of pages, and a web form for setting some top level parameters.
The second level pages have a web form for setting some parameters, a link to the top level page, links to some other two level pages, buttons for starting some long running tasks. Each button has associated timestamps [last time started, last time done, or running].
The website has a database with all the history of parameters for each.

The tree of pages are defined in a markdown file with the following structure:
